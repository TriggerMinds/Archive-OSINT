## Style Guidelines:

- Clean, modern, professional, and information-dense interface optimized for expert users needing efficient data access. Built meticulously with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
- Primarily a neutral palette (grays, whites) ensuring focus on the data, complemented by a clear accent color (e.g., Teal #008080) for interactive elements, calls-to-action, and data highlighting. Includes first-class dark mode support.
- Highly readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter or similar system fonts) selected for clarity and legibility, especially with dense information. A strong typographic hierarchy guides the user.
- Crisp, professional, and instantly recognizable icons (e.g., Lucide library, as configured in components.json) used consistently for navigation, actions, and feature identification.
